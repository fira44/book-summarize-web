# üìö Book Summarizer Web

Welcome to **Book Summarizer Web**! This application allows you to extract and summarize text from PDFs, providing summaries in **both text and MP3 formats**, which you can download and use at your convenience.

## üöÄ Project Evolution

Originally, this project was planned as a SaaS platform to offer book summarization services to a wide audience. Later, I decided to keep it as a personal project on GitHub, allowing for more flexibility, open-source contribution, and experimentation.

## üß† How It Works

The application works in four main steps:

1. **Upload a PDF** ‚Äì Users can upload any PDF file containing the text they want summarized.
2. **Extract Text** ‚Äì The backend extracts the text from the uploaded PDF.
3. **Summarize Content** ‚Äì The extracted text is sent to OpenAI‚Äôs API to generate a concise summary.
4. **Output Options** ‚Äì The summary is available in:

   * **Text format**: View and copy the summary.
   * **MP3 format**: Listen to the summary and download it.

## üîß Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
* **Text Extraction**: `pdf-parse`
* **AI Summarization**: OpenAI API
* **Text-to-Speech**: Browser or server-side TTS (depending on implementation)
